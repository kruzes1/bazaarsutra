I am a Engineering Student, Interested in Financial Markets and Investments, I got no background in the Market, But When I get interested and wanted to learn about Financial Markets, There was no direct way to learn, there was no-one to guide me. About all good courses and workshop regarding Investments were too expensive to afford. Thatâ€™s when I thought about If Some Person would want to learn about all this, How would they? 
I came up with the idea to Summarize all my learnings from different resources and put them at one place, Where anyone can learn for FREE or with Minimal Cost, That we would put to make it work.
And After years of HardWork and Brain-Stroming, I am glad to introduce you to BazaarSutra.
